## A Flexible Staging Server

# The Problem

Staging stuff on Heroku to test changes is too slow.

# The Solution

Run your own server on Amazon Web Services. Just add your AWS token and secret
key to the blueprint configuration and set Ansible to work.  Soon after, the
server will be ready to receive code and run it in lightweight Docker
containers.

# Details

Firstly, using the CloudFormation blueprint, Ansible provisions a single Linux
instance (with all the security groups and access keys and stuff) and configures
it to act as a git+docker server.

Secondly, push code which has a Dockerfile, wait as it gets built and assigned a
TCP port number. Then access the container at http://<instance-hostname>:$PORT/.

Requires: Ansible ~v1.4.
