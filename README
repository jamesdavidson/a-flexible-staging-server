## A Flexible Staging Server

Using Ansible, provision an ArchLinux box running Docker with a git
repo and a post-receive hook (Ruby script).

Then using Git, push code with Dockerfiles to have them run as a
container. Branch master gets linked to port 80, everything else gets
assigned a psuedorandom port number in the 33000-34000 range
(arbritarily chosen).
