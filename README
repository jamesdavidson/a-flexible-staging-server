## A Flexible Staging Server

# The Problem

Staging stuff on Heroku to test changes is too slow.

# The Solution

A blueprint for a staging server on Amazon EC2 (in your nearest data center).
Just add your AWS token and secret key to the config and set Ansible to work.
Soon thereafter, the server will be ready to receive code and run it.

# Details

Firstly, using the CloudFormation blueprint, Ansible provisions a single Linux
instance (with all the security groups and access keys and stuff) and configures
it to act as a git+docker server.

Secondly, push code which has a Dockerfile, wait as it gets built and assigned a
TCP port number. Then access the container at http://<instance-hostname>:$PORT/.

Requires: Ansible ~v1.4.
